# Pirate Intelligent Agent ‚Äì Reinforcement Learning Project

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how reinforcement learning concepts were applied to train an intelligent pirate agent in a simulated environment. The base code provided the environment and basic structure. I implemented the deep Q-learning agent, created a reward mechanism, adjusted hyperparameters, and evaluated the model‚Äôs performance.

## Reflection

**1. What code were you given? What did you create?**  
I was provided with a framework to interact with the environment. I wrote the code that built the reinforcement learning agent, including the model architecture, experience replay, epsilon decay strategy, and training loop.

**2. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists solve problems through algorithm design, automation, and innovation. Their work powers industries ranging from healthcare to aerospace, enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable solutions.

**3. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
I break the problem into smaller parts, design solutions iteratively, and test each step. In this project, I structured the model, trained it, and continuously refined the logic to improve performance.

**4. What are my ethical responsibilities to users and organizations?**  
I must ensure transparency, privacy, and safety in systems I build. Ethical coding practices, fair use of data, and prevention of unintended consequences are crucial.
